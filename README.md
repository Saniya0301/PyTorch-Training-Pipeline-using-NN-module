# PyTorch Neural Network Training & Evaluation Pipeline

This project demonstrates how to **build, train, and evaluate** a simple neural network in PyTorch using the `nn.Module` API.  
It includes data preprocessing, forward & backward passes, and final accuracy calculation.

## 📌 Features
- **Data Loading** — Prepare your dataset for training & testing.
- **Model Definition** — Using `torch.nn.Module` and `nn.Sequential`.
- **Training Pipeline** — Forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, and weight update.
- **Evaluation Step** — Measure accuracy without tracking gradients using `torch.no_grad()`.
